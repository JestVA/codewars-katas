# Kata-log(ue)

This is a collection of solutions to the katas that I complete on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/JestVA) using `JavaScript`.

As the kyu gets lower, the difficulty of the kata increases.

* 8 kyu (good for starters)
* 7 kyu (good for cardio ðŸ¤£)
* .... (mastering fundamentals and more advanced stuff)
* 1 kyu (Ã¼ber coder)

_doing katas_ is one of the best ways to ingrain deep knowledge of programming techniques and concepts. 

At the end of each kata, don't forget to check other coder's solutions as the world is quite creative and it will open your mind to different algorithms. This makes you a _better_ coder.

That's it, I hope that you are convinced to start on your own journey doing katas.

Good luck and see you on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/JestVA)
