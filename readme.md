# Kata-log(ue)

This will be a collection of solutions to the katas that I complete on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/JestVA) using the magnificent `JavaScript` language.

* // 8 kyu
* // 7 kyu
* // 6 kyu

__...and so on__

I have noticed that _doing katas_ is one of the best ways for me to ingrain deep knowledge of the language. 

With each kata that I solve I will spend considerable time skimming through the solutions to see how other coders aproached the same problem and learn from their solutions.

This makes me a _better_ coder as well.

When I solve a kata in 7 lines whilst a solution is possible in 2 lines makes for great __A-HA__! moments. 

That's it, I hope that you will be convinced to do katas on your own as well.

Good luck and see you on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/users/JestVA)
